# Hasan: Avatar Engine + Website

PR #34 follow-up: bundle Inter, Inter Tight and Instrument Serif with the same
Fontsource packages used by the extension. This fixes the CI Turbopack Google-font
resolver error while preserving the website typography and CSS font variables.

Demo integration follow-up: the approved bridge registers 733 actual engine
definitions and preserves digits. On main through PR #30, the extension also
needs localhost API host permission and `VITE_API_URL` at build time. The website
creates its privacy-enhanced iframe before attaching the clock API to fix the
observed black auto-created frame. Actual extension hand motion and caption/gloss
progression were visually verified on CS50 Linear Search at 01:17–01:35;
linguistic readability and >=70% coverage are still open.

> Main plan: [../PLAN.md](../PLAN.md) · Contracts: PLAN §4.1, §4.4, §4.5

You have **two tracks**. The avatar comes first, because it is the hardest and most visible part of the project. Keep the website small: use a template and the pre-built components.

**Branches:** `hasan/player`, `hasan/web`

> **2026-11-01 refresh:** Reconcile your latest branch with the [PLAN §10 baseline](../PLAN.md#10-implementation-baseline-and-next-gates), then follow the **Current integration work for your agent** section below. Original hour targets are historical; retain completed work and attach evidence for new acceptance tasks.

## Track A: Avatar and animation engine

### What you own

- `packages/player`: the `@signstream/player` package
- `packages/sign-assets`: animation clips + `dictionary.json`

### What you deliver

A player that takes a `SignTrack` and the current video time and makes a 3D avatar sign. Poonam (extension) and your own website both use it through the API in PLAN §4.4.

### Approach

1. **Avatar:** a free VRM model (VRoid Hub, or make one in VRoid Studio) loaded with `@pixiv/three-vrm`. VRM has a standard humanoid skeleton with finger bones, which signing needs.
2. **Clips:** each sign is a short JSON list of keyframes: per keyframe, the time plus rotations (quaternions) for the arm, hand and finger bones. Store them in `packages/sign-assets/clips/*.json`.
3. **Making clips (choose by hour 3):**
   - **Option 1, optional pose extraction (quality must be verified):** experiment with MediaPipe landmarks on appropriately licensed reference signing videos, then retarget/calibrate the landmarks onto the chosen rig and clean up the motion before saving clip JSON. Kalidokit is deprecated upstream and is not the default converter. Prototype one compatible extraction path before adopting a browser package/API; tracking alone does not establish valid signs.
   - **Option 2, hand-made keyframes (fastest):** a small internal tool page with sliders for each bone, which exports clip JSON. Useful for static alphabet poses; J and Z also require motion, and hand orientation/placement still need review.
4. **Playback:** `THREE.AnimationMixer`, sampled from absolute media time, with brief bounded transitions where linguistically appropriate and an idle pose in gaps (PLAN §11).

| A4  | Fingerspelling: clips for all letters A–Z; `FS:BOB` plays B-O-B within its allocated sign slot; letter timing is a reviewed pacing target, not an independent timer that overruns the slot                                         | 8                 |

| A8  | `playSign(gloss)` for the `/signs` page; `showGloss` option (current gloss shown under the avatar)                                                                                                                                 | 12                |
| A9  | Performance: lazy-load clips, keep the bundle under ~3 MB without the model, and dispose of WebGL resources in `destroy()`                                                                                                         | 16                |

### Handoffs

- **Available from Raashed:** merged mock track, shared schemas/types and typed API client; use these now. Deployment configuration is still a separate handoff.
- **Available from Durgesh:** measured top-200 CS50 priorities and missing-sign frequencies. Live **Exa** reference links remain pending; do not block the first three manually reviewed clips on those links.
- **Gives Poonam:** a working player package by **hour 6**, even if it only has a few signs. Tell Poonam about any API change right away.
- **Gives Durgesh:** an up-to-date `dictionary.json` (commit it whenever you add clips).

### Stretch

- Eyebrow raise for `nonManual: "question"`, head shake for `"negation"` (using VRM blend shapes)
- 2–3 avatar choices

## Track B: Website

### What you own

`apps/web`: Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind, deployed on Vercel.

**Keep it simple:** use shadcn/ui components. You own the app and build `/watch` and `/signs`. **Ayush builds `/` and `/extension`** inside your app, and you review those PRs. Spend about 30% of your time here and 70% on the avatar.

### Handoffs

- **Needs from Raashed:** the API client from `packages/shared`, the deployed API URL (hour ~10).
- **Gives Ayush:** the scaffolded app with a shared layout (hour 2).
- If you fall behind, **give `/signs` to Ayush at checkpoint 1**. Don't let the website take time from the avatar.

## PR test cases

Every PR must pass these before review (tick them in the PR description). Also see the PR rules in PLAN §9.

- [ ] Player: `load` + `tick` with the mock track plays the right sign at 3 different times (unit test on the scheduling logic)
- [ ] Seeking forward and backward jumps to the right sign; no stuck pose
- [ ] `FS:BOB` fingerspells B-O-B; an unknown gloss falls back to fingerspelling, not an error
- [ ] `destroy()` frees WebGL resources: mount/destroy 10 times with no growing memory in DevTools
- [ ] Runs at ≥ 30 fps in a 300×400 panel on a normal laptop; the 2D fallback renders the same track
- [ ] Every clip listed in `dictionary.json` exists and loads (test that checks the files)
- [ ] Website `/watch`: plays, pauses, seeks and changes speed in sync; shows loading and error states; works at phone width
- [ ] `/signs`: search works; a missing word shows Exa "How to sign it" links; keyboard navigation works

## Definition of done

- [ ] The player package is used by both the extension and `/watch`, without changes between them
- [ ] The avatar plays at least 100 signs + A–Z fingerspelling, crossfades smoothly, and handles seeking
- [ ] The 2D fallback works
- [ ] `/watch` and `/signs` are live on Vercel

## Demo role

During the pitch, show the avatar quality on the `/signs` page: click 3–4 signs and fingerspell a name.

## Current integration work for your agent (H-I, 2026-11-01)

Read PLAN §§10–13 and reconcile any local player/web branch first. Published main
has a player placeholder, empty signs/letters and a web starter. These facts do
not mean local work must be discarded. Do not duplicate already implemented clips.

#### Progress notes (2026-11-01, branch `hasan/signside-web`)

- **B1:** shared layout, brand and pages landed with plain CSS instead of Tailwind/shadcn (the design is custom gradients/glass; PLAN §12 allows existing CSS). Vercel deploy not done yet. UI/frontend guide: [packages/ui/README.md](../packages/ui/README.md).
- **Branding:** the UI says **signside** (logo + wordmark from the design); package names are unchanged.
- **H-I8 (UI only, not ticked):** `/watch` uses the YouTube IFrame API, `useSignTrack` (progress, partial snapshots, cancellation, errors) and the signside panel with a placeholder SVG avatar. Time is polled 5×/s for the caption, not per frame. Still needs the real player.
- **H-I9 (UI only, not ticked):** `/signs` lists signs, searches, fingerspells unknown words and fetches Exa reference links on submit. Still needs `playSign()`.

#### Progress notes (2026-11-01, branch `hasan/signside-player`)

- **Approach changed (A1/A2, H-I1/H-I2):** the avatar is Hasan's procedural WebGL2 engine from the handAnimation prototype, not VRM + JSON clips. It has 49 hand-tuned signs, a 684-line sign lexicon and A–Z with J/Z motion, all computed, so there are no model or clip files to license or load. Docs: [packages/player/README.md](../packages/player/README.md).
- **H-I3 (ticked):** `createAvatarPlayer` implements PLAN §4.4. `buildTimeline` + `poseAt(t)` are pure and binary-search keys by media time. Tests cover three times, boundaries, seeks both ways, repeated glosses, slot fitting and unknown glosses (`packages/player/src/timeline.test.ts`).
- **H-I4 (partly):** seeks snap the springs; pause fades out the idle sway; partial snapshots replace the schedule and keep the clock. Not yet measured at 0.5×/2×.
- **H-I5 (partly):** A–Z including J/Z motion; letters share their sign's slot. Digits in `FS:` are dropped for now.
- **H-I8 (not ticked):** `/watch` now drives the real avatar from `getCurrentTime()` every frame through `AvatarCanvas`, with no React state per frame. Speed changes and a live API error state are not yet verified.
- **H-I9 (ticked):** `/signs` lists the player's own signs (`knownSigns()`, ASL) instead of `/api/signs`, because `dictionary.json` is still empty. Known words play with `playSign`; unknown words fingerspell and show Exa links.
- **Handoff to Durgesh and Raashed:** fill `packages/sign-assets/dictionary.json` `signs` from `knownSigns()` so the gloss prompt can use them. Multi-word keys (`THANK YOU`) need a hyphen convention agreed with Durgesh first, and the clip-path values would become sign names (PLAN §4.5 shape kept).

#### Progress notes (2026-11-01, branch `hasan/avatar-picker`)

- **Stretch: avatar choices (done):** all three painted avatars (Suki, Sara, Sasha) can be picked from the panel header on `/watch`, `/signs` and the extension; the choice is remembered per browser. The player takes an optional `avatar` option (default Sara), an addition to the PLAN §4.4 options that existing hosts can ignore.

- **Landing hero:** the play button was a decorative icon and did nothing. It now links to `/watch?v=w1vhSSu8Nxw`, the stage video chosen in #21/#23; the ID lives in `components/landing/content.ts`. `apps/web` now runs `bun test`, starting with a check that this ID is valid.

### Concrete player semantics

- `tick(t)` samples media seconds; neither `setSpeed` nor mixer timeScale may
  multiply that timestamp again. Preview time is separate from video time.
- Resolve initialization/preloading internally while preserving the synchronous
  public API. Reapply the latest track/time when assets finish. `destroy()` makes
  late async results harmless. Keep initial loading/asset failures visible in
  the player container without inventing another required callback contract.
- `FS:` letters consume the allocated duration as a group. Do not claim a
  0.25-second slot makes a long name readable; report those cases for review.
- Smooth transition windows must preserve meaningful handshapes/strokes. Model
  secondary motion must not keep signing hands moving while the video is paused.
- Use the same bone conventions in authoring, VRM playback and 2D fallback;
  do not mirror left/right hands accidentally when retargeting reference video.

First handoff: working factory export, example `load`/`tick` integration, one
asset folder with dictionary/model/clips, packaging instructions for
`assetsBaseUrl`, and scheduler tests. Poonam must not need MediaPipe or motion
retargeting at runtime. Lottie is optional UI work and is not this player's engine.
Coordinate styling/shared layout with Ayush; Tailwind/shadcn are not installed in
the inspected baseline, so either add the agreed setup or use existing CSS.

### Additional PR test cases

- [ ] Deterministic poses at 0%, 50%, endpoint; arbitrary seeks, pauses and speed changes do not drift.
- [ ] An early partial snapshot, late asset, failed asset and superseded load never show the previous video's sign.
- [ ] Same built model/clip paths load inside the installed extension and `/watch`.
- [ ] All advertised signs and A–Z/digit behavior are visually reviewed; performance/resource evidence includes device and renderer.

### Approved MVP vocabulary/digit bridge

The user explicitly authorized a focused cross-owner player/assets fix. The
procedural engine remains unchanged; no VRM, clip files or new dependencies are
introduced. Dictionary keys now use uppercase/hyphenated words and values are
explicit `procedural:` identifiers rather than pretend clip URLs. The generator
and tests keep the inventory aligned with `knownSigns()`.

Numeric FS no longer disappears: 1–9 reuse existing numeric-word poses and zero
spells ZERO when a native zero pose is unavailable. Mixed letter/digit names
preserve order. A–Z and digits have finite-pose/slot tests; linguistic visual
review and full-corpus coverage remain open. The earlier empty-dictionary/dropped-
digits notes describe the original branch state and are superseded by this bridge.
