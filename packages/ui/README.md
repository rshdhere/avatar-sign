# @repo/ui: signside UI and frontend guide

Owner: **Hasan** · Spec: [specs/hasan.md](../../specs/hasan.md) · Design: the "Sign Language Extension" design board (panel states, browser mock, wordmark, website)

The product is called **signside** in the UI. Package names stay `@signstream/*`; renaming them is a team decision (PLAN §4).
Keep this file up to date when you change the look, a component, or a page.

## What's in this package

| Export                     | What it is                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@repo/ui/sign-panel`      | `SignPanel` (the designed panel) and `Wordmark`                                                              |
| `@repo/ui/avatar-canvas`   | `AvatarCanvas`: the signing avatar from `@signstream/player` as a React component (client only)             |
| `@repo/ui/styles.css`      | All panel/wordmark styles, `ss-` prefixed. Import once per host                                             |
| `@repo/ui/caption`         | `captionAt(track, t)`, `splitAtGloss(text, gloss)`, `trackErrorMessage(code)`, `SPEEDS`/`nextSpeed`           |
| `@repo/ui/youtube`         | `parseVideoId(link)` (watch / youtu.be / embed links or a bare ID), `formatClock(seconds)`                    |
| `@repo/ui/use-sign-track`  | `useSignTrack(api, videoId, lang)`: track + progress + error, partial snapshots, cancels stale requests       |

`SignPanel` is presentational: the host passes `mode` (`none` / `idle` / `signing`), texts, the caption at the
current media time and callbacks. Leaving a callback out hides or disables its control. The signer goes in the
`avatar` slot and is drawn behind the glass cards:

```tsx
<SignPanel
  mode="signing"
  avatar={<AvatarCanvas track={track} getTime={() => player.getCurrentTime()} paused={paused} />}
  caption={captionAt(track, time)}
  /* … */
/>
```

`AvatarCanvas` reads `getTime()` every animation frame itself, so the host only keeps a slow clock (5×/s) for the
caption text. Pass `sign={{ gloss, key }}` instead of `getTime` for one-off previews. How the avatar works:
[packages/player/README.md](../player/README.md).

## Website (`apps/web`)

Next.js App Router, plain CSS (no Tailwind/shadcn: the design is custom gradients and glass, and plain CSS kept it
to a few files). Design tokens and shared layout live in `app/globals.css`; the landing page has its own CSS module.

| Route    | What it does                                                                                                                                        | Owner |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| `/`      | Landing page from the design board. The hero is a live demo: the avatar signs the sample track on a loop, with the subtitle in sync | Ayush |
| `/watch` | `?v=` takes a link or an ID. YouTube IFrame API on the left, signing panel on the right, both on the video's clock; speed chip sets the video rate | Hasan |
| `/signs` | Every sign the avatar knows (from the player) with search; unknown words are fingerspelled and fetch Exa "how to sign it" links on submit only | Hasan |

### Where things live

```text
apps/web/
├── app/                     routes only: layout, page.tsx files, globals.css (tokens, layout, /watch and /signs styles)
├── components/
│   ├── site/                SiteNav, SiteFooter (used by app/layout.tsx)

├── hooks/
│   ├── use-youtube-player.ts  mounts the IFrame player; exposes getTime, paused, rate, setRate
│   └── use-polled-time.ts     media time as React state, a few times a second (captions, live clock)
└── lib/
    ├── api.ts               shared API client (mock when NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is unset) + demoApi for the hero
    └── youtube-iframe.ts    loads the IFrame API once; its types
```

To add a page: a route in `app/<name>/page.tsx` (server, metadata) that renders a view from `components/<name>/`.
Put copy in data, hooks in `hooks/`, and anything the extension could reuse in `packages/ui`.

Run: `pnpm --filter @signstream/web dev`. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to the API origin; without it the site uses the
shared mock data and says "demo" on screen.

## Extension (`apps/extension`)

A Chrome **side panel** (as in the design's "In the browser" board), not an in-page overlay. Same `SignPanel`.
The content script on youtube.com only reports the main video's time/rate to the panel and applies speed
changes; the panel reads the active tab's URL for the video ID and fetches the track only after **Start**, so
opening a video never spends sponsor credits. The avatar is the same `AvatarCanvas`, ticked from
`src/media-clock.ts` (extrapolates the ~4 Hz reports to every frame). Fonts are bundled with `@fontsource` (no network fonts).
Build and load-unpacked steps: [apps/extension/README.md](../../apps/extension/README.md). Owner: Poonam.

## Rules

- Plain CSS, `ss-` prefix for anything in this package; no new UI library without a reason.
- Every interactive thing is a real `<button>`, `<a>` or `<form>`; focus rings stay visible; text on the orange card is dark (white fails contrast).
- Motion: scroll reveals are off under `prefers-reduced-motion`, and the landing demo holds one still sign. A paused video means still hands: `AvatarCanvas paused` fades out the idle sway (PLAN §11.4).
- Never show the previous video's signs: `useSignTrack` ignores results for an old video or language.
- Label mock data as demo data on screen (PLAN G2: mocked runs labelled separately).

## Next

- Fill `packages/sign-assets/dictionary.json` from `knownSigns()` so the gloss module uses these signs (needs Durgesh: multi-word keys).
